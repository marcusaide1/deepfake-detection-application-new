![Architecture Diagram](.docs/archi.png)

### Architecture Overview

The system follows a serverless microservices pattern with the following request flow:

1. **User → CloudFront/S3**: User opens the React app via CloudFront, which serves static content from an S3 bucket.

2. **Frontend → API Gateway**: The frontend sends an image-analysis request to the REST API in API Gateway.

3. **API Gateway → Lambda**: API Gateway invokes the Lambda function, which processes the uploaded image and sends it to the downstream NVIDIA Deepfake Detection API for inference.

4. **Lambda → Secrets Manager**: Lambda retrieves the NVIDIA API key (and other secrets) from Secrets Manager.

5. **Lambda → DynamoDB**: Lambda stores the deepfake detection results and metadata in DynamoDB.

6. **Lambda → S3 (backend)**: Lambda saves the uploaded image (and any derived artifacts) into the backend S3 bucket.

7. **CloudWatch Metrics**: CloudWatch collects metrics and dashboards for Lambda, API Gateway, and other components.

8. **CloudWatch Logs/Tracing**: CloudWatch (and X-Ray/logs) capture detailed logs and traces for debugging and observability.

- **Python** 3.12 or higher
- **AWS CDK** v2 installed globally (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
- **NVIDIA API Key** from [NVIDIA API Catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/hive/deepfake-image-detection)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd DeepFake
   ```

2. **Obtain NVIDIA API Key**

   Visit the [NVIDIA API Catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/hive/deepfake-image-detection?snippet_tab=Python) to generate your API key.

3. **Configure API Key**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```bash
   api-key = "nvapi-your-key-here"
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Install Python dependencies (if using uv)
   uv sync
   
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

5. **Deploy Infrastructure**

   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

   The deployment script will:
   - Deploy all AWS infrastructure stacks
   - Build and deploy the frontend application
   - Configure CloudFront distribution
   - Create CloudWatch monitoring dashboard

6. **Access the Application**

   After deployment, the CloudFront URL will be displayed in the output. The application will be accessible at:

   ```
   https://<cloudfront-distribution-id>.cloudfront.net
   ```

### Local Development

To run the frontend locally for development:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).

## Deployment

### Automated Deployment

The `deploy.sh` script provides a fully automated deployment process with comprehensive error handling:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

#### Deployment Process

4. **Verification**
   - Error checking at each stage
   - Deployment output logging
   - Rollback on failure

### Manual Deployment

For more control, you can deploy stacks individually:

```bash
# Deploy infrastructure stacks
cdk deploy S3Stack DynamoDBStack SecretsStack LambdaStack ApiGatewayStack DashboardStack

# Build frontend
cd frontend && npm run build && cd ..

# Deploy frontend stack
cdk deploy FrontendStack
```

1. **AWS Console**: Navigate to CloudWatch → Dashboards → DeepFake-Monitoring-Dashboard
2. **Frontend Banner**: Click the "Monitoring Dashboard" banner in the application UI

### Metrics Tracked

#### Lambda Metrics

- **Invocations**: Total number of function executions
- **Errors**: Failed invocations and error rate
- **Duration**: Average execution time
- **Throttles**: Rate limiting events

#### API Gateway Metrics

- **Request Count**: Total API requests
- **4XX Errors**: Client-side errors (bad requests, unauthorized, etc.)
- **5XX Errors**: Server-side errors
- **Latency**: Request processing time (p50, p95, p99)

### Log Analysis

- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Delete `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

#### Runtime Errors

**Issue**: Lambda function timeout

**Solution**:
- Check CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages
- Verify NVIDIA API key is valid and active
- Increase Lambda timeout in `lambda_stack.py`
- Check S3 bucket permissions

**Issue**: API Gateway returns 502 errors

**Solution**:
- Verify Lambda function is deployed and healthy
- Check Lambda function logs in CloudWatch
- Verify API Gateway integration configuration
- Check CORS settings

**Issue**: Frontend cannot connect to API

**Solution**:
- Verify `.env` file contains correct API endpoint
- Check CORS configuration in API Gateway
- Verify API Gateway deployment is complete
- Check browser console for specific error messages

### Getting Help
